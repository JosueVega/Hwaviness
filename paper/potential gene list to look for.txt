Polar hyphal tip growth through microtubule (+ end tracking) 

 a priori Genes 
Hypothesis:
Genes involved in the Hyphal Growth and response to stimulus
	Look at Kinesins (+ end mediated)
	Mitochondria in the Spitzenkorper 
		(apical aggregate if secretiry vesicles
	Myosin - polarized growth/secretions 
	Changing in [Ca2+]
	gene NhKIN1 - kinesin encoding 
		reduced hyphal waviness (during knockout) 
	Spitzenkorper movement genes (kinesins involved)
